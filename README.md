## Flo VIO challenge

- To get a working visual odometry solution for a given dataset

### About the dataset
> Note : The datasets provided are in rosbag format
1. [cam_imu.bag](https://inhouse-vision-dataset.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/cam_imu.bag) - calibration dataset
3. [phone_imu.bag](https://inhouse-vision-dataset.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/phone_imu.bag) - dataset to calibrate imu 
4. [zed_imu.bag](https://inhouse-vision-dataset.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/zed_imu.bag) - dataset collected with a zed 2 camera, contains imu data
5. [seq41.bag](https://inhouse-vision-dataset.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/seq41.bag) - general dataset containing visual inertial information
6. [seq42.bag](https://inhouse-vision-dataset.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/seq42.bag) - general dataset containing visual inertial information 

### Instructions:
1. Fork this repo
2. cd into the `data` directory and run `download.sh`
3. Push your solution's source code to your forked repo
4. Append to this README file on how one can run your solution against the dataset
